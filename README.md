# ScanMe
Transform your notes to HighQuality PDFs!

## Description
Scanning of documents no longer requires the use of bulky devices and can be achieved leveraging the vast improvement in Computer Vision technologies. We can now feed the image to software specialized to convert these into PDF documents. 

After ban of the most used application for this purpose (Cam-Scanner)[1], we came up with idea to develop our own software with additional functionalities.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Go into the ScanMe directory

``` 
 cd ./ScanMe

3. Run gui.py file

```
python3 gui.py
```

## Usage
1. Click on upload to select files. Selection of multiple files for stitching is allowed.
2. Select the Various features and Click on Save as PDF.
